<H1>Customizing the IDE - Changing the default project settings
</H1>

<P>
You probably build most of your applications with the same compiler
and linker options. For example, you may always build applications
using the large memory model and pre-compiled headers. 
<P>
If you regularly use non-standard compiler settings, a memory
model other than small, or paths that differ from the default
settings, you may have to change these parameters each time you
start a new project. Fortunately, you can determine the default
settings for these options in new projects. In this article, we'll
show you how to save your favorite project options as default
settings. 
<H3>The default project file</H3>

<P>
The Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) stores
all the default compiler options, the default paths, and the default
memory model in the default project file, TCDEF.DPR (TCDEFW.DPR
for the Windows-hosted IDE). The IDE stores this project file
in the IDE's home directory (typically, \BORLANDC\BIN).
<P>
To change the default options for new projects, we'll first
close any existing project file that may be open. Otherwise, the
IDE will save any changes we make to project-related options in
the open project's PRJ file.
<P>
Next, we'll set our compiler options and paths, and then
select a memory model. These settings are going to become the
defaults for all new projects, so we'll need to be sure
we choose settings appropriate for most of our projects.
<P>
Finally, we'll save the new project options. If there isn't
an open project file when you save project settings, the IDE puts
those settings in the default project file. Now, let's
change the default options for new projects.
<H3>Changing your default SETTINGs</H3>

<P>
To begin, we'll launch the Windows version of the IDE.
When the main IDE window opens, make sure there isn't an
open project. As Figure A shows, when a project file is open,
the IDE enables the Close Project command in the Project menu.

<P><STRONG> 
Figure A - You'll need to close an open project file before you can change the default project settings.

<P>
If another project file is open, choose Close Project from the
Project menu to close it. Now you'll be able to save your
new project options to the default project file.
<P>
Now, choose Compiler from the Options menu, and then choose Code
Generation&#133; from the Compiler submenu. Click the Large radio
button in the Model section to specify the new default memory
model. Then, select the Pre-compiled Headers and Duplicate Strings
Merged check boxes from the Options section to specify the new
compiler settings. When you finish making these changes, the Code
Generation Options dialog box should resemble the one shown in
Figure B.

<STRONG> 
Figure B - You set the memory model and general compiler options from the Code Generation Options dialog box. 
</STRONG>
<P>
Click the OK button to close this dialog box. Your project changes
are now in the  compiler's memory. For these changes to
take effect, you'll need to save them to the project's
disk file.
<P>
Choose Save&#133; from the Options menu. When the Save Options
dialog box appears, deselect the Environment and Desktop check
boxes, and leave the Project check box selected, as shown in Figure
C.

Figure C - You save the current project settings from the Save Options dialog box. 
</STRONG>
<P>
Click the OK button to save your project options to the default
project file. Now, let's create a new project that uses
our customized default options.
<H3>Using the new default SETTINGs</H3>

<P>
Choose Open Project&#133; from the Project menu. When the Open
Project File dialog box appears, enter <I>TEST.PRJ </I>in the
File Name text box, as shown in Figure D.

<STRONG> 
Figure D - New projects will now use your custom project defaults. 
</STRONG>

<P>
Choose Compiler from the Options menu, and then choose Code Generation&#133;
from the Compiler submenu. When the Code Generation Options dialog
box appears, confirm that the new memory model and compiler settings
are in effect for this project.
<P>
Click the Cancel button to close this dialog box, and then choose
Close Project from the Project menu to close the new project file.
Choose Exit from the File menu to shut down the IDE.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
The default project options in the Borland C++ IDE are frequently
inappropriate for new projects. In this article, we showed you
how to modify the default project file. By using this technique,
you can start each new project with your favorite project-related
options.

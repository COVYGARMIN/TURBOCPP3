SECTION 0 System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------

A. Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
To install and run Borland C++Builder, you must meet the
following minimum system requirements:

* 16 MB RAM (24 MB recommended)
* 80486 processor or better
* Windows 95 or Windows NT (3.51 or 4.0)
* 80 to 175 MB of free hard disk space (195 MB for
  the Client/Server Suite), subject to the 
  installation options you choose and cluster
  size.


B. Compact Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
A minimum installation of Borland C++Builder includes Borland
C++Builder, as well as the Borland Database Engine, and is
called the "Compact" install by the installation program. It
does not include the Database Desktop, Local InterBase, or SQL
Links.  A compact installation of Borland C++Builder will take
approximately 80 MB of hard disk space.  To perform a compact
installation, choose the "Compact" installation option on the
installation options page.


C. Full Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
A full installation of C++Builder includes all the tools
available, the Windows-hosted IDE, and allows development for
32-bit Windows.  This is called the "Full" install by the
installation program, and requires approximately 125 MB of hard
disk space.


D. Installation Conflicts
---------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid potential conflicts when Setup installs system files,
we recommend that you close down all other running applications
before installing Borland C++Builder.  To get a listing of
applications running on your machine, either:

- Under Windows 95:
  Look at the taskbar on which the Start button is located. 
  OR
  Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete (once) and look at your Close Program
  list (click Cancel to exit the list).

- Under Windows NT 4.0:
  Look at the taskbar on which the Start button is located. 
  OR
  Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete (once), and choose Task Manager to 
  see the list of programs running on your system 
  (Choose File|Exit Task Manager to exit the list).

- Under Windows NT 3.51:
  Double-click on the background (behind Program Manager).
  This brings up the Task List (click Cancel to exit
  the list).


E.  Installing C++Builder, Interbase, and InstallShield Express
---------------------------------------------------------------
Not all of the listed products below are available in all
versions of Borland C++Builder.  Listed below are all the
relevant paths to the various setup programs, and the packages
that each product is included in.

1) Borland C++Builder (all packages)
   To install Borland C++Builder from the CD, 
   run \SETUP\CBUILDER\SETUP.EXE

2) Local InterBase (Client/Server and Professional packages only)
   To install Local InterBase, 
   run \SETUP\LOCALIB\DISK1\SETUP.EXE

3) InterBase Server (Client/Server package only)
   To install the InterBase Server, 
   run \SETUP\SERVERIB\DISK1\SETUP.EXE

4) InstallShield Espress (Client/Server and Professional
   packages only)
   To install InstallShield Express,
   run \SETUP\ISX\SETUP.EXE

---------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1. Installation Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------

A. Known Installation Issues
---------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Installation sometimes reports misleading "out of disk
    space" error message.

    If you install Borland C++Builder on a drive other than
    the drive on which Windows resides, check to be sure that
    you have more than 32 MB of disk space free on your Windows
    drive (usually C:).  Otherwise, it is possible that the
    installation program will report that you have run out of
    disk space.  This usually does not mean that you ran out of
    space on the drive on which you are installing Borland
    C++Builder.  It usually means that you ran out of space on
    the Windows drive, because C++Builder must install several
    files into the Windows directory structure.

    Also note:  If you install separate components on different
    drives on your machine, the disk space reported per drive
    and for each component may be incorrect.  You should
    manually ensure that you have enough disk space for each
    component before attempting to install it.

2.  Install program unable to create groups with certain
    characters.

    In the installation, when you get to the screen where you
    can specify the name of the program group you want to be
    created, you cannot include parenthesis '(' and ')' or
    commas ',' in the group name.

3.  Problems using Symantec's Norton Navigator.

    If you have Symantec's Norton Desktop for Windows 95
    installed and you launch \SETUP.EXE from the Navigator, you
    will see the Borland C++Builder installation begin, but
    instead of the installation displaying on the desktop, it
    will be viewable through the main view only.  The
    installation is still running, but it is just not visible
    on the desktop.

4.  Cannot install while uninstall running.

    If you attempt to run \SETUP.EXE while a copy of the
    uninstall program is running, you will receive errors.
    DO NOT run the installation program while the uninstall is
    running.  If you're not sure if the uninstall is running,
    follow the instructions in Section 0 D to determine what
    is running on your machine before running \SETUP.EXE.


B. Hard Drive Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
Installing from a CD-ROM may cause synchronization difficulties
between various pieces of hardware or certain hardware drivers.
If you suspect that your CD-ROM drive or your CD-ROM driver
might be at fault, you can attempt a hard drive installation.

To begin, copy the entire setup directory into a temporary
directory on your C:\ drive. The setup directory contains all
the files needed for the installation.  Once these have been
successfully copied, restart your machine in SAFE MODE or VGA
MODE by following the appropriate instructions in section 2 of
this document, and then attempt to install the product.

When running the install, remember to change the SOURCE 
directory so that it points to the temporary directory.


C. Files Available on the CD
---------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the files installed in your target directory by the 
SETUP.EXE program are on the distribution CD in the CBUILDER 
directory. You must use SETUP.EXE to install C++Builder, but 
you can copy files from this directory tree on the CD if any 
files are lost or damaged during or after installation.


---------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2. Changing Your System Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you change your system configuration if
you encounter problems when installing new software.
Windows 95 and Windows NT each have their own method, as
follows.


A. Safe Mode Boot under Windows 95 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Under Windows 95, the method for booting in a simple system
configuration is through safe mode, a boot option provided on
the startup menu. To boot in Safe Mode, follow the instructions
below:

1. Shut down the machine and reboot.
2. Before the Windows 95 splash screen appears
   (but after the 'BEEP'), press F8.
3. Select Safe Mode from the menu and press Enter.
   You are now running in Windows 95 Safe Mode. 
   Windows 95 informs you that you are running in a 
   special diagnostic mode. Click OK and you
   will be able to continue your work.

Note:  Windows 95 does not recognize most CD-ROM drives in
       Safe Mode.  If this is the case for your machine, 
       you'll need to copy the files from the SETUP 
       directory on the CD onto your hard drive and install 
       from there (see hard drive install, section 1).


B. VGA mode Boot under Windows NT 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Windows NT 3.51 uses a different method for changing to a
simple system configuration.  To boot in VGA mode, follow the
directions below:

1. Shut down the machine and reboot it.
2. When the OS choice menu appears, select number 2, 
   Windows NT Workstation [VGA mode].
   Windows NT will then boot itself in a clean mode.


C. Additional Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to following the appropriate instructions for your
operating system in this section, be sure to follow the other
instructions in section 0 regarding programs running in the
background during installation.  The Safe Mode and VGA Mode
boot processes remove extraneous drivers, but do not
necessarily keep programs from running.


---------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3. Troubleshooting Installation Error Messages
---------------------------------------------------------------
This section contains a list of the most common error messages
that can occur during installation. Each error message includes
a suggested solution.  If you receive errors that are not
listed here, please contact the Installation Line at the phone
number listed in Section 5 of this document.

-2:   Unable to open input file
      Check that the Source directory is specified correctly, 
      and that the file being copied is located in that
      directory.

-3:   Unable to open output file
      Check that the Destination directory is specified
      correctly, and that the file does not already exist in
      that directory.  Also make sure that you have access
      rights to write to the Destination directory.

-4:   Unable to write to file.
      Check the integrity of the source disk as well as the 
      destination disk.  Make sure that there are no errors
      on either disk

-6:   Memory allocation error.
      Not enough memory is currently available for the
      installation to proceed.  Close down other applications
      to free memory.

-9:   Source and target directories conflict.
      Make sure that the source directory listed and the target
      directory listed are different.

-27:  Unable to create directory
      The installation program was unable to create the target 
      directory specified.  Please check that this directory
      does not already exist and that you have access
      privileges to that area.

-38:  Not enough disk space on target drive
      There is not enough hard disk space on the target drive
      specified.  Free more space before attempting to
      reinstall.

-46:  Target file is read-only
      The file currently being written is marked as read-only
      and cannot be overwritten.  Delete or rename the
      currently existing copy of this file before continuing.

-401: String too long
      Your system path statement is too long.  Check your path
      and shorten if possible.


---------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4. Registry Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------
The registry under Windows 95 and Windows NT is the file where
information concerning all software added to the system is
logged and kept for reference. You can access the registry by
using the registry editor (regedit or regedt32 under Windows NT
3.51) to view and change the registry, if necessary. (There is
almost never a reason to do this manually.) 

Following is a list of changes made to the registry when 
Borland C++Builder is installed.


A. Key Names added
---------------------------------------------------------------
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\C++Builder
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\DBD

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\C++Builder
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\BLW32
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\Database Engine
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\InterBase
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\OpenHelp


B. File Extension Associations
---------------------------------------------------------------
These are the file extension associations kept in the registry
under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mak  = "BCBProjectFile"

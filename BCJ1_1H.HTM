<H1>Letter from the Editor - Welcome to <I>Borland C++ Developer's Journal</I>
</H1>

<P>
Well, you have to admit that developing software in today's
market is anything but boring. New languages, changes in compiler
technology, changes in design philosophy, and other industry trends
are making the developer's job more challenging than ever.
<P>
However, you've already taken a significant step towards
keeping pace with these changes by selecting Borland C++ as your
development tool. And we're going to help you make the
most of that investment. 
<P>
Each month we'll tackle the hot topics that you face when
you program with Borland C++. Whether you're a beginner
moving from Turbo C++, an experienced C programmer making the
C++ transition, or a long-time C++ user, we'll show you
how to leverage the features of Borland C++ to gain a competitive
advantage.
<P>
First, we're going to focus on Windows programming. No
one argues the popularity of this market, but all developers seem
to be struggling with design and implementation issues. Fortunately,
the ObjectWindows class library and application framework can
help you build on the experience of Borland's Windows programming
experts, and we'll show you how to use and extend the 
ObjectWindows class library.
<P>
Second, we're going to cover DOS programming since many
of you are still writing DOS applications. For DOS apps, Borland's
TurboVision class library is even more valuable than ObjectWindows
because it virtually stands alone as a DOS application framework.
We'll make sure that if you're writing for DOS,
you know how to use and extend TurboVision.
<P>
Finally, we'll address language, design, and implementation
issues. When necessary, we'll even go &quot;under the
hood&quot; to show you why some things happen in C++ the way
they do.
<H3>Conventions</H3>

<P>
Since this is the first issue of <I>Borland C++ Developer's
Journal</I>, you need to understand some of our editorial conventions.
First, we compile Windows applications from the Windows-hosted
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and DOS applications
from the DOS IDE. If a particular topic applies to both IDEs,
we use the Windows IDE as a default.
<P>
When you need to enter something from the keyboard, we typically
show the text in italics, as in <I>BABY.TXT</I>. However, if you
need to enter an entire line of code or a DOS command, we'll
call it out from the body text, as in<BR>

<PRE>
return momboFunction(globalVariable);<BR>

</PRE>

<P>
Anytime we mention a C or C++ reserved word, or an identifier
from an example, we use the same style that we use for the code.
For example, <TT>return</TT>,<TT> class</TT>, and <TT>private</TT>
are reserved words.
<H3>What version?</H3>

<P>
We'll always cover the latest version of Borland C++. Currently
this is version 3.1. However, if we need to tell you how to do
something with a previous version, we'll always tell you
that the article applies specifically to that version of Borland
C++.
<P>
Most of all, we want to write articles that benefit as many of
you as possible. For us to know how to balance our coverage of
different versions, we need to hear from you.
<H3>Tell us what you want</H3>

<P>
We want to know what you think of <I>Borland C++ Developer's
Journal</I>. If you like our approach, let us know. If we can
do better, let us know how. We want you to be happy with this
journal. Finally, if you have a question about using Borland C++,
we want to hear it.

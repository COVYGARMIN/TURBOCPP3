<H1>Product Support - Getting Borland C++ support on a pay-per-call basis
</H1>

<P>
Have you ever needed a fast answer to a technical question about
Borland C++, only to find out that your local expert is on vacation?
If so, you might want to take advantage of one of Borland's
pay-per-call telephone support programs. In this article, we'll
tell you how.
<H3>The Credit Card Advisor Lines</H3>

<P>
You can charge technical support calls to your credit card by
calling one of two numbers. If you're writing Windows applications,
call (800) 782-5558. If you're writing DOS applications,
call (800) 368-3366. The first time you call, an operator will
ask you for your name, address, and the number and expiration
date of your credit card. Then the operator will give you a Personal
Identification Number (PIN). The next time you call, you simply
enter your PIN, followed by the pound sign (#), and Borland will
bill any charges you incur to your credit card account.
<P>
When you call the Credit Card Advisor Line, you'll speak
to one of Borland's senior technical support engineers.
The first minute is free, and each additional minute costs $2.00.
Time you spend on hold is not billed to your account.
<P>
You can call the Credit Card Advisor Line from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday. The Credit Card Advisor
Line accepts MasterCard, VISA, and American Express.
<H3>The Borland C++ (900) Advisor Line</H3>

<P>
If you don't want to charge support to your credit card,
you can call (900) 555-1002 (Windows) or (900) 555-1004 (DOS)
and pay the fees on your telephone bill. When you call this line,
you'll speak to a senior technical support engineer. The
first minute is free and each additional minute costs $2.00. However,
you will be charged for any time you spend on hold when you call
this line. This service is also available from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday. <BR>

<H3>Free information on the Express Support Line</H3>

<P>
In addition to pay-per-call support, Borland offers a fully automated
modem response system that provides up-to-date technical information
about Borland C++, TurboVision, and ObjectWindows. Just call (408)
431-5250 and choose a topic by answering the system prompts. You
can call the Express Support Line 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
